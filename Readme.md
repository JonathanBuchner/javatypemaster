# TypeMaster

## Description
TypeMaster is a ‘typing program’ that tracks the time a user takes to write a few lines of java code.  The program loads typing challenges stored in markdown files, the user selects a challenge, and the program displays and records the amount of time it took to complete the challenge. The user can see their fastest time and the fastest time amongst all users, encouraging the user to retake challenges to achieve faster and faster times.  The program design purposefully includes topics covered in CSCI E-10B such as event-driven programming using Swing and AWT classes as the program is a graded class assignment.

## Running the program
In a command line:
- In the root directory move into the ‘src’ folder
- Type javac .\TypeMaster.java
- Type java TypeMaster

A user will need a java installed and may follow instructions on the CSCI E-10B site.

## Running the test runner
In a command line tool:
- Go into the ‘src’ folder
- Type javac TestProgram.java
- Type java TestProgram
Test results will be printed to the command line.  A user will need a java installed and may follow instructions on the CSCI E-10B site.
