# For Loop
*For loop is one of the most commonly used loop in programming. It is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. As a loop, it executes a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.*

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}

for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```
